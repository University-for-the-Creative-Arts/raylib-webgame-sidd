## How to compile with Emscripten (emcc)?

To compile a program with Emscripten (emcc), first ensure that Emscripten is installed and activated using source ./emsdk_env.sh in your terminal. Then, use the emcc command to compile your C or C++ source code into WebAssembly (.wasm) and accompanying JavaScript or HTML files. For example, running emcc main.cpp -o index.html compiles main.cpp into an HTML file that can be run in a web browser. You can also generate only JavaScript (-o output.js) or WebAssembly (-s WASM=1) outputs, and include optimization flags like -O2 or -O3 for performance. Emscripten provides additional options for linking libraries, setting the runtime environment (-s ENVIRONMENT=web), or exposing functions for JavaScript interaction. Once compiled, you can serve the generated files locally using emrun index.html or a simple HTTP server to test your program in a browser.

## How to serve and play in a browser (e.g., python3 -m http.server 8000)?

To serve and play your Emscripten-compiled project in a web browser, you need to run a local web server since browsers block direct file access for WebAssembly and JavaScript modules. One of the simplest methods is to use Pythonâ€™s built-in HTTP server. Navigate to the directory containing your compiled files (e.g., index.html, .js, and .wasm), then open a terminal and run python3 -m http.server 8000. This command starts a local server on port 8000, which you can access by opening your web browser and visiting http://localhost:8000. Your Emscripten output page will load just like a regular website, allowing you to test and interact with your WebAssembly application directly in the browser environment.
